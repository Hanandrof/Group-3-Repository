1.1 Project Overview
This project is a web-based educational environment on the topics of fitness and wellness, 
as solicited by the United States Department of Education. While it is purchased on a 
school-wide basis, the platform's main demographic 
will mainly be young athletes and their parents, who for it has been determined that they 
are lacking in knowledge on the practice of proper nutrition and fitness routines to
support their own physical education training.

1.2 Project Deliverables
- Use Cases for each participant in the system, including:
  + The System Administrator
  + Physical Education Coaches
  + Experts on The Platform
  + People Without an Account
  + Parents of The Athlete Participants on The Platform
  + The Student Athlete Participants
  + The School Administration Group
