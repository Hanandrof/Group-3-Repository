1.1 Project Overview
This project is a web-based educational environment on the topics of fitness and wellness, 
as solicited by the United States Department of Education. The platform's main demographic 
will mainly be young athletes and their parents, who for it has been determined that they 
are lacking in knowledge on the practice of proper nutrition and fitness routines to
support their own physical education training. This website will have different accounts that can be purchased.

1.2 Project Deliverables
- Use Cases for each participant in the system, including:
  + The System Administrator
  + Physical Education Coaches
  + Experts on The Platform

1.3 Evolution of the SPMP
As the Gantt timeline continues to change, so will the timeline
section change as well. This has been managed by Brandon as he 
updated the Gantt chart to reflect the current state of our project.

Project Organization
----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Process Model
The website will be hosted by namecheap which will also host Wordpress. 
The domain and SSL certificate was purchased and applied via namecheap. 
We will build the website via Wordpress and host the game using an iFrame plugin that allows to access other sites within a webpage. We will use Buddypress, which interacts with "BuddyPress Restrict Group Creation" to restrict (not at the moment) group creation among roles. Code Snippets is used within Wordpress to give more forms to the login process and store these forms in the database. Loginizer helps protect security on WordPress. Paid Memberships Pro works with loginizer and gives subscription levels/payment process. Social Snap Lite lets us talk to Twitter/Facebook. User Menus/Role Editor provide a user experience for users of the site. The Store Locator helps the Map function for the site and works alongside the Google Maps API.


2.2 Organizational Structure
Refer to https://github.com/Hanandrof/Group-3-Repository/blob/main/Deliverables/Week_4/High_Level_Architecture.png
This shows the high level architecture of the given website. This website will be built using namecheap/wordpress and available wordpress plugins. We will interact with the WP databases in order to build our game and tailor it to the individual user.

2.3 Organizational Interfaces
- Relationship to Hosting Service
Our project is not of a controversial nature, so as long as we keep paying
them to host a site, they will do it.
- Relationship to WordPress
What licenses do they use? Generally, most upstream frameworks use open-source
licenses, so as long as we're not using Adobe Flash in 2021, we should
be fine.
- Relationship to WordPress Plugins
We use multiple wordpress plugins in order to make a functioning website. We have included a list of plugins below
  - Paid Memberships Pro
  - Buddy Press
  - Buddy Press Restrict Group Creation
  - Code Snippets
  - iframe
  - Loginizer
  - LoginPress - Customizing the WordPress Login
  - Paid Memberships Pro
  - Paid Memberships Pro - BuddyPress Add on
  - Paid Memberships Pro - Register Helper Add on
  - Paid Memberships Pro - Require Strong Password 
  - Simple Iframe
  - Social Snap Lite
  - Templates Patterns Collection
  - User Menus
  - User Role Editor
  - WP Store Locator
  
- Relationship to Paypal
Used for getting payments from users, only implemented via sandbox mode. Implemented on WP via Paid Memberships Pro.
- Relationship to Google Maps
Used for locating gyms in an area. Implemented on WP via WP Store Locator.

2.4 Project Responsibilities
Frontend and backend development will be lead by Akeem, Alex, and Jackson. This includes the creation of pages through WordPress, database design and implementation, and other development and plugins.

Game development and design will be headed by Stanley. The game will be preceded by a lesson and quiz to drive home the educational benefits of it.

Project documentation will be written and updated by Brandon.

Managerial Process
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Management Objectives and Priorities
-Management philosophy
The team will be segmented into project responsililites as outlined in 2.4. Our management is split up between project teams, when we have class we have weekly management meetings discussing what work has been done and what work needs to be done; after that, we adjust the goal posts to our capabilities. 

-Priorities among requirements

  -	Utilization of social media to promote and increase awareness and usage.
    -Low Priority: Not needed to make the site function as a whole, but provides much needed advertisement.

  -	Be secure. Provide all functionality without ever leaving the domain.
    -Medium Priority: Some stuff may need to leave domain (social media), however most can stay in domain.

  -	Provide a way to search for local fitness facilities. 
    -High Priority: One of the main functions of the site.

  -	Allow parent/guardians to get a subscription for their child/children.
    -Low Priority: If we can get more money

  -	Allow high school athletic coaches and officials to view athletes participating in their program.
    - High Priority: This is a core of the website

  -	Allow fitness, health and nutrition experts the ability to register their services.
    - High Priority: Need to be on the activity Page

Prioritize first the website's function, then its form. This means the website pages should be functional before we make them pretty and the game should have a playable state implemented into the site first before worrying too much about aesthetics.
To display website function, the creation of a working lesson prototype should be prioritized.

-Schedule
Work acording to the Gantt. Gantt will be updated to reflect project changes
-Budget
Operating under a 'broke college student' budget. Costs should be kept as close to zero as possible. This was not met.

3.2 Assumptions, Dependencies and Constraints

-External events the project depends on
We were able to get a hosting service and domain name. Our site is dependent on the hosting service continuing to function.

-Constraints under which the project is to be conducted
Biggest contraint is time, the deadline cannot be changed. Requirements cannot be cut, but superflous details may be removed so we can meet the deadline.

We are able to implement the Google Maps API sufficiently, currently using credit from Jackson a.k.a  the website is constrained to the amount of credit Jackson has.

3.3 Risk Management
Project Scope - There are some aspects of the site that may prove too large in scope to complete in a timely fashion.
These elements can be reduced or eliminated as needed as long as we continue to ensure the requirements are met.

Client acceptance - To avoid a rejection late into development, we plan to meet frequently with the client and keep them up to date and on board with all major project details.
This should alleviate the concern of their acceptance as they will not be in the dark about anything. If there are objections they can be accounted for and implemented quickly.

Plugin Conflict - some plugins may interact poorly with eachother and this imposes risk on getting the project done in a timely fashion. This has been seen best from BuddyPress conflicting with the login process, we have worked through documentation to try to mitigate said problem.

Website Crash - some code may cause the website to crash and this will be mitigated by automatic backups.

Malicious Attack - this project is using Loginizer from Wordpress to help prevent these kinds of attacks and to maintain security. There is a malware scanner built in with the host (i.e. namecheap).

3.4 Monitoring and Controlling Mechanisms
Project management will monitor progress on a weekly basis, this role should fall to Brandon as documentation leader. 
This will be done inside the Gantt chart, the SPMP. We will alert members of our team to get work done and to update on work via Discord.

4.2 Software Documentation
Documentation will be contained within site code and within the repository. Brandon will lead the documentation of updates and new additions.

4.3 Project Support Functions
Plan to ensure quality assurance - Documentation lead's weekly reviews will function as mini-QA sessions.
Proper documentation will be in the code structure and carried out on the GitHub here. There will also be a documentation folder for the clients in the head of the repository.
Functional baselines (WordPress pages, JS base) shouldn't be changed without formal consideration.
Development will have achange control process, changes will be brought to the group to deliberate and approve based on merit and minimal risk. 
A record of all changes made will be kept within this document and on other documents as needed.
Previous version backups will be kept for testing purposes.
