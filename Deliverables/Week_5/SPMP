Introduction

1.1 Project Overview
This project is a web-based educational environment on the topics of fitness and wellness, 
as solicited by the United States Department of Education. While it is purchased on a 
school-wide basis, the platform's main demographic 
will mainly be young athletes and their parents, who for it has been determined that they 
are lacking in knowledge on the practice of proper nutrition and fitness routines to
support their own physical education training.

1.2 Project Deliverables
- Use Cases for each participant in the system, including:
  + The System Administrator
  + Physical Education Coaches
  + Experts on The Platform
  + People Without an Account
  + Parents of The Athlete Participants on The Platform
  + The Student Athlete Participants
  + The School Administration Group

1.3 Evolution of the SPMP
As the Gantt timeline continues to change, so will the timeline
section change as well. Here it has been decreed.

Project Organization
----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Process Model
Relationships among project elements
2.2 Organizational Structure
Internal management, organization chart

2.3 Organizational Interfaces
- Relationship to Hosting Service
Our project is not of a controversial nature, so as long as we keep paying
them to host a site, they will probably do it.
- Relationship to Schools
Access to this system is purchased annually on a school-wide basis. They are
the customers, even though they are not necessarily the consumers.
- Relationship to Upstream Frameworks
What licenses do they use? Generally, most upstream frameworks use open-source
licenses, so as long as we're not using Adobe Flash in 2021, we should
be fine.
- Relationship to US Dep't. of Education
Mostly fictitious.

Managerial Process
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Management Objectives and Priorities
-Management philosophy
team discussion needed
-Priorities among requirements
Prioritize first the website's function, then its form.
To display website function, the creation of a working lesson prototype should be prioritized.
-Schedule
Work acording to the Gantt
-Budget
Operating under a 'broke college student' budget. Costs should be kept as close to zero as possible.

3.2 Assumptions, Dependencies and Constraints
-External events the project depends on
can't think on any
We are able to get a hosting service (should be easy as one would expect).
We are able to implement the system
The continuation of the universe, planet, and the concept of existence.
-Constraints under which the project is to be conducted
Biggest contraint is time

3.3 Risk Management
Identification and assessment of risk factors, mechanism for tracking risks, implementation of contingency plans

Size of the project
What do you do if you feel project is too large?

Complexity of the project
What do you do if the requirements are multiplying during analysis? (requirements creep)

Client acceptance
What do you do if client does not like developed prototype?

3.5 Monitoring and Controlling Mechanisms
Frequency and mechanisms for reporting


Technical Process
