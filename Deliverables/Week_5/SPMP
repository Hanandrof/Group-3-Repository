1.1 Project Overview
This project is a web-based educational environment on the topics of fitness and wellness, 
as solicited by the United States Department of Education. While it is purchased on a

are lacking in knowledge on the practice of proper nutrition and fitness routines to
support their own physical education training.

3.1 Management Objectives and Priorities
-Management philosophy
team discussion needed
-Priorities among requirements
Prioritize first the website's function, then its form.
To display website function, the creation of a working lesson prototype should be prioritized.
-Schedule
team discussion needed
-Budget
Opperating under a 'broke college student' budget. Costs should be kept as close to zero as possible.

3.2 Assumptions, Dependencies and Constraints
-External events the project depends on
can't think on any
-Constraints under which the project is to be conducted
Biggest contraint is time

3.3 Risk Management
Identification and assessment of risk factors, mechanism for tracking risks, implementation of contingency plans
