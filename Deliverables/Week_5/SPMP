Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 Project Overview
This project is a web-based educational environment on the topics of fitness and wellness, 
as solicited by the United States Department of Education. While it is purchased on a 
school-wide basis, the platform's main demographic 
will mainly be young athletes and their parents, who for it has been determined that they 
are lacking in knowledge on the practice of proper nutrition and fitness routines to
support their own physical education training.

1.2 Project Deliverables
- Use Cases for each participant in the system, including:
  + The System Administrator
  + Physical Education Coaches
  + Experts on The Platform
  + People Without an Account
  + Parents of The Athlete Participants on The Platform
  + The Student Athlete Participants
  + The School Administration Group

1.3 Evolution of the SPMP
As the Gantt timeline continues to change, so will the timeline
section change as well. Here it has been decreed.

Project Organization
----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Organizational Structure
Refer to Organiztional Structure.png

2.2 Organizational Interfaces
- Relationship to Hosting Service
Our project is not of a controversial nature, so as long as we keep paying
them to host a site, they will probably do it.
- Relationship to Schools
Access to this system is purchased annually on a school-wide basis. They are
the customers, even though they are not necessarily the consumers.
- Relationship to Upstream Frameworks
What licenses do they use? Generally, most upstream frameworks use open-source
licenses, so as long as we're not using Adobe Flash in 2021, we should
be fine.
- Relationship to US Dep't. of Education
Mostly fictitious.

2.4 Project Responsibilities
Frontend and backend development will be lead by Akeem, Alex, and Jackson. This includes the creation of pages through WordPress, database design and implementation, and other development and plugins.

Game development and design will be headed by Stanley. The game will be preceded by a lesson and quiz to drive home the educational benefits of it.

Project documentation will be written and updated by Brandon.


Managerial Process
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Management Objectives and Priorities
-Management philosophy
The team will be segmented into project responsililites as outlined in 2.4
-Priorities among requirements
Prioritize first the website's function, then its form. This means the website pages should be functional before we make them pretty and the game should have a playable state implemented into the site first before worrying too much about aesthetics.
To display website function, the creation of a working lesson prototype should be prioritized.
-Schedule
Work acording to the Gantt. Gantt will be updated to reflect project changes
-Budget
Operating under a 'broke college student' budget. Costs should be kept as close to zero as possible.

3.2 Assumptions, Dependencies and Constraints
-External events the project depends on
We were able to get a hosting service and domain name. Our site is dependent on the hosting service continuing to function.
We are able to implement the google maps API sufficiently.

-Constraints under which the project is to be conducted
Biggest contraint is time, the deadline cannot be changed. Requirements cannot be cut, but superflous details may be removed so we can meet the deadline.

3.3 Risk Management
Project Scope - There are some aspects of the site that may prove too large in scope to complete in a timely fashion.
These elements can be reduced or eliminated as needed as long as we continue to ensure the requirements are met.

Client acceptance - To avoid a rejection late into development, we plan to meet frequently with the client and keep them up to date and on board with all major project details.
This should alleviate the concern of their acceptance as they will not be in the dark about anything. If there are objections they can be accounted for and implemented quickly.


3.4 Monitoring and Controlling Mechanisms
Project management will monitor progress on a weekly basis, this role should fall to Brandon as documentation leader.


Technical Process
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 Methods, Tools and Techniques
Specify the  methods, tools and techniques to be used on the project
- Git
- Agile
- HTML/CSS/Javascript
- monday.com --- to manage tasks inside the group
- Namecheap Domain / Hosting
-cPanel --- website and server management
- WordPress (s2Member plugin)
- https

4.2 Software Documentation
Documentation will be contained within site code and within the repository. Brandon will lead the documentation of updates and new additions.

4.3 Project Support Functions
Plan to ensure quality assurance - Documentation lead's weekly reviews will function as mini-QA sessions.
Proper documentation will be in the code structure and carried out on the GitHub here. 
Functional baselines (WordPress pages, JS base) shouldn't be changed without formal consideration.
Development will have achange control process, changes will be brought to the group to deliberate and approve based on merit and minimal risk. 
A record of all changes made will be kept within this document and on other documents as needed.
Previous version backups will be kept for testing purposes.
