Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 Project Overview
This project is a web-based educational environment on the topics of fitness and wellness, 
as solicited by the United States Department of Education. The platform's main demographic 
will mainly be young athletes and their parents, who for it has been determined that they 
are lacking in knowledge on the practice of proper nutrition and fitness routines to
support their own physical education training. This website will have different accounts that can be purchased.

1.2 Project Deliverables
- Use Cases for each participant in the system, including:
  + The System Administrator
  + Physical Education Coaches
  + Experts on The Platform
  + People Without an Account
  + Parents of The Athlete Participants on The Platform
  + The Student Athlete Participants
  + The School Administration Group

1.3 Evolution of the SPMP
As the Gantt timeline continues to change, so will the timeline
section change as well. Here it has been decreed.

Project Organization
----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Process Model
The website will be hosted by namecheap which will also host Wordpress. The domain and SSL certificate was purchased and applied via namecheap. We will build the website via Wordpress and host the game using a Code Snippets plugin that allows javascript code. {fill out more}

2.2 Organizational Structure
Refer to Organiztional Structure.png

2.3 Organizational Interfaces
- Relationship to Hosting Service
Our project is not of a controversial nature, so as long as we keep paying
them to host a site, they will do it.
- Relationship to WordPress
What licenses do they use? Generally, most upstream frameworks use open-source
licenses, so as long as we're not using Adobe Flash in 2021, we should
be fine.
- Relationship to WordPress Plugins
We use multiple wordpress plugins in order to make a functioning website. We have included a list of plugins below
  - Paid Memberships Pro
  - Buddy Press
  - Buddy Press Group Restricter
  - Code Snippets
  - Other Things
  - WP Store Locator
  
- Relationship to Paypal
Used for getting payments from users, only implemented via sandbox mode.
- Relationship to Google Maps
Used for locating gyms in an area.

2.4 Project Responsibilities
Frontend and backend development will be lead by Akeem, Alex, and Jackson. This includes the creation of pages through WordPress, database design and implementation, and other development and plugins.

Game development and design will be headed by Stanley. The game will be preceded by a lesson and quiz to drive home the educational benefits of it.

Project documentation will be written and updated by Brandon.


Managerial Process
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Management Objectives and Priorities
-Management philosophy
The team will be segmented into project responsililites as outlined in 2.4
-Priorities among requirements
Prioritize first the website's function, then its form. This means the website pages should be functional before we make them pretty and the game should have a playable state implemented into the site first before worrying too much about aesthetics.
To display website function, the creation of a working lesson prototype should be prioritized.

-Schedule
Work acording to the Gantt. Gantt will be updated to reflect project changes
-Budget
Operating under a 'broke college student' budget. Costs should be kept as close to zero as possible.

3.2 Assumptions, Dependencies and Constraints

-External events the project depends on
We were able to get a hosting service and domain name. Our site is dependent on the hosting service continuing to function.

-Constraints under which the project is to be conducted
Biggest contraint is time, the deadline cannot be changed. Requirements cannot be cut, but superflous details may be removed so we can meet the deadline.

We are able to implement the google maps API sufficiently, currently using credit from Jackson a.k.a  the website is constrained to the amount of credit Jackson has.

3.3 Risk Management
Project Scope - There are some aspects of the site that may prove too large in scope to complete in a timely fashion.
These elements can be reduced or eliminated as needed as long as we continue to ensure the requirements are met.

Client acceptance - To avoid a rejection late into development, we plan to meet frequently with the client and keep them up to date and on board with all major project details.
This should alleviate the concern of their acceptance as they will not be in the dark about anything. If there are objections they can be accounted for and implemented quickly.

Plugin Conflict - some plugins may interact poorly with eachother and this imposes risk on getting the project done in a timely fashion.

Website Crash - some code may cause the website to crash and this will be mitigated by automatic backups.

Malicious Attack - this project is using Loginizer from Wordpress to help prevent these kinds of attacks and to maintain security. There is a malware scanner built in with the host (i.e. namecheap).

3.4 Monitoring and Controlling Mechanisms
Project management will monitor progress on a weekly basis, this role should fall to Brandon as documentation leader. 


Technical Process
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 Methods, Tools and Techniques
Specify the  methods, tools and techniques to be used on the project
- Git
- Agile
- HTML/CSS/Javascript
- monday.com --- to manage tasks inside the group
- Namecheap Domain / Hosting
-cPanel --- website and server management
- WordPress (buddypress)
  - Insert Plugins Here
- https (SSL Certificate)

4.2 Software Documentation
Documentation will be contained within site code and within the repository. Brandon will lead the documentation of updates and new additions.

4.3 Project Support Functions
Plan to ensure quality assurance - Documentation lead's weekly reviews will function as mini-QA sessions.
Proper documentation will be in the code structure and carried out on the GitHub here. 
Functional baselines (WordPress pages, JS base) shouldn't be changed without formal consideration.
Development will have achange control process, changes will be brought to the group to deliberate and approve based on merit and minimal risk. 
A record of all changes made will be kept within this document and on other documents as needed.
Previous version backups will be kept for testing purposes.
